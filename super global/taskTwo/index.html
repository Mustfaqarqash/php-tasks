It seems like you're trying to create a simple webpage that acts as a search engine where users can enter a URL and then get redirected to that URL when they click the "GO" button. However, there are a few corrections needed in your PHP code to achieve this functionality correctly.

Here's how you can adjust your PHP code:

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>URL Redirection Search Engine</title>
</head>

<body>
